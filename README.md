# Scadpy Monorepo

This is a monorepo for parametric 3D printed parts and utilities. It contains:
*   **Pure OpenSCAD Projects**: Hand-written SCAD files.
*   **Python-Generated SCAD**: Parametric models built with `solidpython2`.
*   **Utilities**: Python tools for generating labels, visualizing mockups, etc.

It uses **OpenSCAD** for CAD/Compilation and **Python** (via `uv`) for generation and scripting.
